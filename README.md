#Milestone 1: alternative RW2020
Me and my friends go yearly to a music festival that is called Rock Werchter.
Due to the corona pandemic that festival was cancelled. The strict lockdown that we had became more lenient in June so my friend that it would be fun to have a little Rock Werchter party in his back garden. That gave me the idea to make a “fake” website for that party and give it a look and feel of the official website https://www.rockwerchter.be/nl/ .
It is by no means a copy but more a parody of the website with pictures of me and my friends from earlier editions of de festival.    

UX
If you have ever seen the official Rock Werchter site the frontpage should seem familiar.
Also navigating the site should feel the same and there are a lot of pictures(atmosphere impressions). Since the site is a parody and for a good laugh there is no real information on the website. Also the color scheme is not a copy since the color scheme of the official website changes from time to time. 

Design
You can find the wireframes that I used for this project *****. 
The real wireframe was of course the official RW2020 website(now the RW2021 website is live!). The header and footer are visually copied and the section is more or less my own interpretation.
Features
In this project I added the following features:
General
•	A navigation menu with a linear-gradient which is on top of the banner and on smaller screens it is under the banner 
•	The date-location container is always on top of the banner.
•	The navigation menu has a scroll over effect and shows on which page the user is.
•	Most of the pictures have a zoom in effect when the user scrolls over them.
•	The pictures scale with the screen size but on small screens they are simply shown under each other.  
•	The footer has social links that link to the official RW social pages. 
•	These social links scale with the screen size.
•	Every page has a textbox that is under the banner and has the same layout and color scheme. When the navigation menu moves to under the banner the textbox is pushed down.

•	The frontpage footer has sponsor links that link to the official sponsor website. 
•	On the frontpage(home) there is a video that can be played

COMBATIBILITY
I tested  my site on three browsers in both desktop(laptop) and mobile configuration. 
I also looked at the site on my phone and tablet that run android. I did not test on an Apple device or browser.  

•	Chrome
•	Edge
•	Firefox

I also checked my CSS code on https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator and got the following errors.
45 	.menucontainer 	Ongeldig getal : background 45deg geen linear-gradient waarde )
302 	.picture-container 	Ongeldig getal : background 45deg geen linear-gradient waarde )
431 	.signup-form 	Ongeldig getal : background 45deg geen linear-gradient waarde )
I ignored these errors since the code works as expected.

Noted issues 
Scaling of the pictures is not optimal. Next time I’m going to take a better look at the size(amount of pixels) a picture has. Also I’m not really happy with the pictures in the CSS. That is something I’m going to do fundamentally different next time.  

Deployment
This project was created using Github. From there I used Gitpod.io to write my code. Then I used commits to git followed by pushes to my GitHub repository.
As my final step I've deployed this project to GitHub Pages from the GitHub repository using the following steps:
1.	Login to my GitHub account
2.	Go to the Alternative-RW2020-1 repository
3.	Go to the settings-tab
4.	Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5.	At the GitHub Pages section, choose "master branch" as your source
6.	The page will now automatically refresh and the repository deployed
7.	You can now scroll down again to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link for the website
To run this project locally the following steps should be followed:
1.	You can follow this link to the Alternative-RW2020-1 repository
2.	Click on the green colored button "Clone or download"
